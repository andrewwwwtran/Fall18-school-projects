memory concepts
	- variable names correspond to locations in the computer's memory
	- every variable has a name, type, and a value
	* when a value is placed in a memory location, the value replaces the precious value in that location.
	- when a value is read out of a memory location, the process is nondestructive
	- good practice is if you're not going to init you variable with something, init it with null.
		- just so when you launch you will know which variable was undeclared.

control statements
	- js provides loops
		while, do-while, for, for-in
	- js interpreter ignores white-space characters
		blanks, tabs, and newlines used for indentation and vertical spacing
