what happens to the files when the client requests the files?
	the server just sends back the html/css/js files for the browser to interpret
	what about php files on server side?
		what is getting sent back from php files is the results of the php file
			ie. if the php file says to print "hello" then "hello" will be sent back,
			Not print "hello"
we should know the difference between having scripts on client side and server side.
Client Side Scripting ch 6
	all major web browsers contain JS interpreters which process the commands written in javascript.
	input script into html file inside head element
		<script type = "./javascript.js"></script>
	embedded js in html ex.
		document.writeln("<h1>welcome</h1>");
	javascript uses the Document Object Model (DOM): an object representation of an HTML Document
	object
		the term object normally implies that attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) are associated with the Object
		script calls the methods
		ie. document.writeln(); //document is the object and writeln() is the method for document to print to page.
	case sensitive, need semicolons
	need closing script tag
	syntax for separate js file
		<script src="./myscript.js"></script>
	if you use writeln() in the middle of a paragraph, it won't show in the browser because html ignores line breaks.
	displaying text in an Alert dialog
		window.alert(""); does a popup with text to grab the user's attention.
	if doing embedded scripts
		bad practice to put it in head element because content belongs in body element
		metadata, links, belong in head element
	escape sequences in js,
		backslash is encountered in a string of char, the next char is combined with the backslash to form an escape sequence in js.
		the escape sequence \n is the newline character. it causes the cursor in the html5 doc to move to the beginning of the next line.
		in strings \" will produce a " , \' will produce ' , \\ will produce \ , \n produces a new line
	html forms are used to collect data from the user
	scripting gives you the ability to generate part or all of a web page's content at the time it is shown to the user.
		such web pages are said to be dynamic since it has the ability to change.
	some debugging tools
		console.log() -> outputs a message to the web console
		console.dir() -> displays an interactive listing of the properties of a specified js object.
	to declare a variable in js use
		var myvariable;
		variable names start with letter ,can include numbers, $$ and ___
	if variable is declared but not initialized, it'll return as undefined.
	parseInt
		converts its string argument to an integer. important when taking input from the user to use in a numeric context.

memory concepts
	- variable names correspond to locations in the computer's memory
	- every variable has a name, type, and a value
	* when a value is placed in a memory location, the value replaces the precious value in that location.
	- when a value is read out of a memory location, the process is nondestructive
	- good practice is if you're not going to init you variable with something, init it with null.
		- just so when you launch you will know which variable was undeclared.
CH 7 CONTROL STATEMENTS
7.4
	- js provides loops
		while, do-while, for, for-in
	- js interpreter ignores white-space characters
		blanks, tabs, and newlines used for indentation and vertical spacing
7.5/7.6
	if...else
	- if(this is true){
			do this;
		}else{
			do that;
		}
	- can be nested
	if(this is true){
		do this;
	}else if(this is true){
		do that;
		if(this is true){
			do this;
		}
	}
	- another way to do if else
		condition ? true : false ;
		ie.	grade >= 50 ? "passed" : "failed";
7.7
	while loop
	- while(this is true){
			do this;
		}
	- if it's never false, result in an infinite loop
7.8
	counter controlled repetition
	- often called definite repetition, because the number of loops is known before the loop is executed.
	- for loops, while loops with counter, any loops with counters.
	- javascript represents all numbers as floating point numbers in memory
		often developed through division
	- if string is passed to parseInt() and it's a floating point number, then the number is truncated
	- if string passed to parseInt() does not begin with a number, parseInt() returns NaN (not a number)
		to check javascript provides isNaN(), returns true if its not a number, otherwise false.
7.9
	sentinel-controlled repetition
	- sentinel value aka signal value aka dummy value aka flag value
		indicated end of data entry
	- indefinite repetition because number of repetition is not known in advance
		choose a sentinel value that cannot be confused with acceptable input value
7.10
	nested control statements
	while(true){
		while(true){
			if(true){
				if(false){
					execute;
				}
				exe;
			}
			exe;
		}
		end first while loop;
	}
7.11
	assignment operators
	- javascript provides += -= /= *= %=
7.12
	increment and decrement operators
	- if operator is prefixed, ++i, i gets incremented then used
	- if its postfixed, i++, i gets used then incremented
	- equality
		- If the types of the two expressions are different, attempt to convert them to string, number, or Boolean.
		- null equals both null and undefined
		- Values are considered equal if they are identical strings, numerically equivalent numbers, the same object, identical Boolean values, or (if different types) they can be coerced into one of these situations.
	- identity
		- === and !==
			- these work like the equality operators except that it doesn't attempt to convert them.
			- types must be the same to be considered equal
